# Motivation
The present repository contains miscellaneous thoughts and research, documenting the state of my knowledge as I continue to gain exposure to a set of technical, managerial, and business issues.

All views expressed are my own, and do not reflect views of any organization which I am a part of, or have been a part of.

# Target audience
This blog is not intended for a massive audience, though it aims to be written in a way that is relatively easy to understand, and minimize prerequisites. The first target is me, but there is the underlying hypothesis that the issues I met and am discussing here, others will have also been challenged with, and will find it useful to review my own reflections/solutions.

# References
For the sake of personal productivity, I may quote instead of paraphrasing articles and remote sources, in which case such a source should be systematically included in a bibliographical section. If you shall find an exception to this rule, please let me know, so I can make appropriate amends.
